## Styles

Conventions:

- Global styles live in `src/styles/globals.css` and are imported once in `src/app/layout.tsx`.
- Page styles live in `src/styles/pages/` as CSS Modules and are imported by each page.
- Component styles should go in `src/styles/components/` as CSS Modules (create as needed).
